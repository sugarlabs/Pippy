# jeringoso is an innocent spanish way to talk used by kids,
# you need to add an "p" before earch spanish vowel (a,e,i,o,u) and
# the same vowel after the "p"
# then you got a funny way to talk that parents will not understand.
# ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeringonza

# first we define the spanish vowels
vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']

# then we ask for a string to make the replacements
text = input("Please input your text to translate to jeringoso:")
length = len(text)
jeringoso = ""
for i in range(length):
    char = text[i]
    if char in vowels:
        jeringoso = jeringoso + char + "p" + char
    else:
        jeringoso = jeringoso + char

print(jeringoso)
